## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

<img style="float: left;" src="valerie/readme/images/t2valm.png"> With tensions rising between Baldur's Gate and Amn, and rumors of unnatural disasters plaguing Amnish territory on the Sword Coast, the Cowled Wizards of Amn have become involved in the looming conflict. Dedicated to controlling the use of magic in Amn and destroying magical threats to that nation, on the Sword Coast they act in support of the Amnish army. And with the rumors of demons in the mines of Nashkel, one young Cowled Wizard has taken it upon herself to learn the truth of the matter. Adventurers willing to work with a Cowled Wizard will find a willing ally in their Nashkel investigations and beyond.

The Valerie NPC mod contains a friendship for a PC of any race and gender with flirt opportunities for both genders that can be considered PG material.

&nbsp;

**Content:**
- A friendship with flirtation opportunities for PCs of any race, alignment, and gender with a reputation of at least 10.
- Player-initiated dialogue.
- Banters with the original Bioware NPCs.
- Numerous interjections and comments on the world of Baldur's Gate.
- The beginning of a character and relationship that will eventually return in Baldur's Gate II with new developments and opportunities.
- An original portrait drawn by the highly talented Hannah Wallance.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BG2:EE), the conversion projects <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=143&Itemid=98">Baldur's Gate Tutu</a>, <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

The Tales of the Sword Coast (TotSC) expansion is not required to play the Valerie NPC mod. This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods for BG TuTu, BG:EE  or BGT, including BG1NPC. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/617-valerie/">report them on the forum</a>!

>Although it is not required for Valerie NPC to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-valerie.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **valerie** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG

Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Valerie NPC for BGII for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: valerie folder and a setup-valerie.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-valerie.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-valerie`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Valerie NPC for BGII for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: valerie folder, setup-valerie and setup-valerie.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-valerie.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-valerie.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Valerie NPC for BGII for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **`cd`** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-valerie`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games), and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-valerie --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="details" id="details"></a>Details

<img style="float: left;" src="valerie/readme/images/t2valm.png"> Valerie is a sorceress and member of the Cowled Wizards of Amn, Amn's organization dedicated to protecting Amn from magical threats and controlling the use of magic within the country. Fresh from her apprenticeship, Valerie has been sent to Nashkel in response to rumors of demons plaguing the mines, with orders to confirm or deny these rumors. With the local army forces paralyzed, however, Valerie is willing to work with adventurers to investigate the mines and the greater crisis looming over the region. Empathic, intellectual, and a devout follower of Torm, the god of duty and loyalty, Valerie is a far cry from the stereotypical sorcerer and will happily befriend a native of the Sword Coast who isn't blatantly evil. You can find Valerie in the middle of Nashkel.

#### Biography

> Valerie is quiet when asked about her past, finding her feelings about it mixed. She was cast out of her family as a child when she displayed signs of magical talent, a deeply suspicious sign in Amn with its cultural distrust of magic. She was found and taken in by the Cowled Wizards, the nation's arcane police, who taught her how to use and control her abilities. Upon completing her apprenticeship, she was posted to Nashkel with the Amnish army where you met her.

## 

#### Important notes

Valerie has a number of dialogues that only occur at rest in an inn, so if you haven't heard from her for a while, try staying somewhere nice.
